## React-router 的三个主要工作
- Subscribing and manipulating the **history stack**.<br/>
  > what is **history stack**, try to hold the back button in a browser you can see the browser's history stack right there.
- Matching the URL to your **routes**.<br/>
  > what is **routes**, a tree of routes objects that will be ranked and matched(with nesting).
- Rendering a nested UI from the route matches(An array of routes of the route config that matches the current location.)

## About the history stack
There are five steps
1. clicks a link to /dashboard
2. clicks a link to /accounts
3. clicks a link to /customers/123
4. clicks the back button
5. clicks a link to /dashboard
   
The history stack will change as follows where **bold** entries denote the current URL

1. `/dashboard`
2. /dashboard, `/accounts`
3. /dashboard, /accounts, `/customers/123`
4. /dashboard, `/accounts`, /customers/123
5. /dashboard, /accounts, `/dashboard`
   
## History object
- 客户端渲染中，通过`window.history.pushState`可以改变URL，但是对UI没做什么事情，而且浏览器没有给出合适的监听URL变化的方法。
```javascript
window.addEventListener("popstate", () => {
  // URL changed!
});
```
- 该事件监听仅仅在用户点击前进后退按钮才会被触发。`window.history.pushState` 和 `window.history.replaceState` 不会触发`popstate`事件
- 于是React-router中特制的“history”亮相了
```javascript
let history = createBrowserHistory();
history.listen(({ location, action }) => {
  // this is called whenever new locations come in
  // the action is POP, PUSH, or REPLACE
});
```
- Apps don't need to set up their own history objects--that's job of `<Router>`. It sets up one of these objects, subscribe to changes in the history stack, and finally updates its state when the URL changes. This causes the app to re-render and the correct UI to display. The only thing it needs to put on state is a location, everything else works from that single object.

## Locations
- the location concept in **React Router**
```javascript
let location =
{
  pathname: "/bbq/pig-pickins",
  search: "?campaign=instagram&popular=true",
  hash: "#menu",
  state: null,
  key: "aefz24ie"
};
```
一般来讲 `URL = locaiton.pathname + location.search + location.hash`

### About Location's properties
- `location search` 取值
```javascript
// we can turn the location.search into URLSearchParams
let params = new URLSearchParams(location.search);
params.get("campaign"); // "instagram"
params.get("popular"); // "true"
params.toString(); // "campaign=instagram&popular=true",
```
- `location state` 的使用
```javascript
<Link to="/pins/123" state={{ fromDashboard: true }} />;

let navigate = useNavigate();
navigate("/users/123", { state: partialUser });
//next page
let location = useLocation();
location.state;
```
- `location key`
Example: a very basic client side data cache could store values by location key and skip fetching the data when user clicks back into it

## Two ways to navigating in React Router
- `<Link>`
- `navigate`


## Router Components
`BrowserRouter` 

- Type declaration
```typescript
declare function BrowserRoute(props: BrowserRouterProps): React.ReactElement

interface BrowserRouterProps {
  basename?: string;
  children?: React:ReactNode;
  window?: Window;
}
```
- `<BrowserRouter>` create a **history**, puts the initial location in to state, and subscribe to the URL.
  > the **history** is an object that allows react router to subscribe to changes in the URL as well as providing APIs to manipulate the browser **history stack** programmatically.
